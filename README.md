# To-Do App

This To-Do app is built using the **Clean Architecture** template by [Jason Taylor](https://github.com/jasontaylordev/CleanArchitecture). The app follows clean architecture principles to ensure maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns, providing a solid foundation for building modern web applications.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required to build and run the solution:

- **.NET 9.0 SDK** (latest version)
- **Node.js** (latest LTS version)

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the `ClientApp` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ClientApp
   ```

2. Install the required npm dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

3. After that, navigate to the `src/Web` directory:
   ```bash
   cd src/Web
   ```

4. Finally, run the application using the .NET CLI:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

This will build and run the app locally.
